# spam_classifier
This is a Python program that implements a classifier to classify an email as spam or not. I used a training dataset from Kaggle. I applied some pre-processing steps using NLTK libraries, divided the dataset into training, validation and testing. I implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch for the classifier. I validated the model and tested the model to determine the accuracy of the model.
